# ðŸ“„ Metadata

Metadata and the format of it is important when you interopering with other dApps, as well as when you want your tokens to be understood by other clients.

Therefore, Yours Protocol enforces a specific schema on your metadata when you:

1. Transfer tokens to other dApps.
2. When a client wants to fetch information of tokens on your dApps.

In order for your module to include all its data into the metadata, all you have to do is to extend a function. For examples, see:

{% content-ref url="getting-started/making-your-tokens-interoperable.md" %}
[making-your-tokens-interoperable.md](getting-started/making-your-tokens-interoperable.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
